# Summary

Add to the obs-studio windows installer the option to download and install python

# Motivation

It is often difficult to get python scripts working for regular users, due to needing to download a specific version of python, that is not easily found on the python site

# Drawbacks

Adds an extra step to the installer

# Additional Information
My thought is

* Add a checkbox "Add Python Scripting Support"
* If checked, download and install the correct python MSI
* Add python path to the "python settings" config file
* Yay! people can now more easily run python scripts on windows!!!
